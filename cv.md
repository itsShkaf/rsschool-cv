##About Meself

Let me speak from the heart.
In 2011 he graduated from college with a degree in electrical engineering.
I graduated from the Polytechnic University in 2016 as an Industrial Engineer.
In 2018 he graduated with a Master's degree in Engineering.
He has been working since 2017 at the production in Moscow as a shift master. Then he was promoted to the Head of the masters. At that time, he opened grocery stores in Moscow, but unfortunately these stores were not crowned with success.
Then, while working in Moscow, with a companion, he began to build a food truck in Gomel, production and full filling took 1.5 years.
In 2022 he left Belarus and moved to Spain.
I chose programming as the fastest way to integrate into the work environment here.
